Kube-state-metrics is a tool that generates metrics from the Kubernetes API server. It queries the Kubernetes API server to retrieve the state of various Kubernetes objects, such as deployments, replicasets, pods, and services, and generates metrics based on the information it collects.

The metrics generated by kube-state-metrics include:

Deployment metrics: The number of replicas, the number of available replicas, and the current generation of the deployment.

ReplicaSet metrics: The number of replicas, the number of available replicas, and the current generation of the ReplicaSet.

Pod metrics: The phase of the pod (running, waiting, or terminated), the pod status, the container status, and the restart count.

Service metrics: The number of endpoints for the service.

Node metrics: The capacity and usage of CPU and memory on each node.

Namespace metrics: The number of pods, services, and other resources in each namespace.

Job metrics: The number of successful and failed job completions.

The metrics generated by kube-state-metrics are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters. They can be used to identify issues with deployments, replica sets, pods, and services, and to track resource utilization across the cluster. By providing detailed insights into the state of Kubernetes objects, kube-state-metrics can help you improve the reliability and performance of your Kubernetes applications.
