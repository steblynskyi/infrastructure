Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit originally developed by SoundCloud. It is designed to collect, store, and query time-series metrics data from various sources, including applications, systems, and networks.

Prometheus uses a pull-based model to collect metrics data, where it periodically scrapes targets (such as services or nodes) and stores the resulting data in a time-series database. It also provides a powerful query language, PromQL, for querying and analyzing the collected data.

In addition to collecting and storing metrics data, Prometheus also provides a range of features for monitoring and alerting. This includes:

Graphical visualization of metrics data using tools like Grafana
Alerting based on user-defined rules, which can be triggered based on threshold values, patterns, or other conditions
