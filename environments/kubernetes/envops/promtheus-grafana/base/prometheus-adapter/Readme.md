The Prometheus Adapter is a component of kube-prometheus that allows you to use Prometheus queries to get metrics from Kubernetes APIs. Without the Prometheus Adapter, you won't be able to use PromQL queries to retrieve Kubernetes API metrics.

The Prometheus Adapter is important because it enables you to use Prometheus queries to monitor Kubernetes objects, such as pods, nodes, deployments, and services. This can provide you with a lot of valuable information about the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster.

If you remove the manifests related to the Prometheus Adapter from kube-prometheus, you will not be able to use PromQL queries to retrieve Kubernetes API metrics, which will limit your ability to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. So, it's not recommended to remove the Prometheus Adapter manifests from kube-prometheus.
